### About Hailo Libero 3.0

The Hailo Libero 3.0 is an automatic, hands-free cabinet door opening system designed for waste bin cabinets. It uses a laser sensor to detect hand movement and automatically opens the cabinet door, providing a hygienic, touch-free solution for your kitchen.

## Features

## Installation

1. Install the adapter from the ioBroker admin interface
2. Configure the device IP address, port, and password in the adapter settings
3. Optionally adjust the polling interval for status updates

## Configuration

2. **Local Network**: Configure the device to connect to your local WiFi network and use the assigned IP address

## Important Notes

- **API Reverse Engineering**: Since Hailo does not provide official API documentation, this adapter uses reverse-engineered endpoints from the device's web interface. Some features may require adjustment based on your specific device firmware version.
- **Network Connectivity**: Ensure your ioBroker host can reach the Hailo Libero device on your network
- **Firmware Compatibility**: This adapter is designed for Hailo Libero 3.0. Compatibility with other versions is not guaranteed.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Check that your ioBroker host can ping the device
- Ensure the device password is correct (default: `hailo`)
- Check your network firewall settings

### Device Not Responding

- Try restarting the Hailo Libero device
- Verify the device's WiFi connection is active
